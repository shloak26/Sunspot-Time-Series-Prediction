# Sunspot-Time-Series-Prediction
Sunspot Time Series Prediction using 1D Covnent and LSTM in Tensorflow

About Data: 
Sunspots are temporary phenomena on the Sun's photosphere that appear as spots darker than the surrounding areas. 
They are regions of reduced surface temperature caused by concentrations of magnetic field flux that inhibit convection. 
Sunspots usually appear in pairs of opposite magnetic polarity. Their number varies according to the approximately 11-year solar cycle.

Model:
I used most trending and till date state of art time series prediction method of using 1D Convolution Neural Network
and LSTM over that in Tensorflow to predict the Sunspot activity. Used optimized hyperpaters like batch size, window size,
learning rate to achive a minimum Mean Absolute Error.
